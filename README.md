Abstract
This project shows how to classify german traffic signs using a modified LeNet neuronal network.
The steps of this project are the following:
•	Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
•	Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
•	Design, train and test a model architecture
•	Use the model to make predictions on new images
•	Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
